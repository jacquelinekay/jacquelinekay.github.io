hi. I am a software engineer currently open for remote contracts.

I enjoy talking about software, especially C++ and robotics. I'm trying to blog about it too (which is why this website exists).

Some of my previous work includes:

  - Software engineer at [Marble](marble.io), bootstrapped infrastructure, CI, and robot navigation.
  - developer on ROS/ROS 2 at the [Open Source Robotics Foundation](http://www.osrfoundation.org/).
  - developer on [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), the open source physics simulator for robotics
  - [demos for the Baxter Research Robot](https://github.com/osrf/baxter_demos)
  - research on time-dependent path planning at CMU Lunar XPrize lab ([poster]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/kay-poster-riss13.pdf))

Here's my CV as [a pdf]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/jackie-kay-cv.pdf).

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014, where I played a lot of Ultimate Frisbee.

Nobody calls me Jacqueline, except when they tag me on Github.
