hi. I am a software engineer living in San Francisco, CA.

I'm currently at [Marble](marble.io).

Some of my previous work includes:

  - developer on ROS/ROS 2 at the [Open Source Robotics Foundation](http://www.osrfoundation.org/).
  - developer on [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), the open source physics simulator for robotics
  - [demos for the Baxter Research Robot](https://github.com/osrf/baxter_demos)
  - research on time-dependent path planning at CMU Lunar XPrize lab ([poster]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/kay-poster-riss13.pdf))

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014, where I played a lot of Ultimate Frisbee.

Nobody calls me Jacqueline, except when they tag me on Github.
