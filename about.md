hi. I am a software engineer in Mountain View, CA.

I currently work at the [Open Source Robotics Foundation](http://www.osrfoundation.org/), on the [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) team.

Most of my time is spent developing ROS 2, the next generation open source robotics middleware framework.

I am also a maintainer (but not the original author) of:

  - [robot_model](https://github.com/ros/robot_model), tools for parsing and managing the description of a robot
  - [robot_state_publisher](https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher), tool for changing and publishing the state of a robot
  - [urdfdom](https://github.com/ros/urdfdom) and [urdf_parser_py](https://github.com/ros/urdf_parser_py), parser for URDF (robot description format)

Some of my previous work includes:

  - developer on [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), the open source physics simulator for robotics
  - [demos for the Baxter Research Robot](https://github.com/osrf/baxter_demos)
  - research on time-dependent path planning at CMU Lunar XPrize lab ([poster]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/kay-poster-riss13.pdf))

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014, where I played a lot of Ultimate Frisbee.

Nobody calls me Jacqueline, except when they tag me on Github.
