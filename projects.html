    In spring 2014, I researched and implemented a supervised learning system for the <a href="http://icub.org/">iCub</a> robot simulator with my classmate Kate Derosier, now a neuroscience PhD student at UCSF. Inspired by research from the Centre for Cognitive Science at Comenius University, we modeled a biologically inspired <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">mirror neuron</a> system for imitative learning. You can read more about our work <a href="assets/mirror-neurons.pdf">here</a>.

    For my first hackathon, NYUHacks 2013, I designed an app for Facebook that randomly replaces the names of characters from a famous work of literature with the names of the user's top friends. <a href="http://ec2-54-221-103-142.compute-1.amazonaws.com/">Face Libs''</a> has a Javascript frontend and a natural language processing engine written in Python using NLTK, the natural language toolkit. HTML and design work was done by my collaborator <a href="fr.linkedin.com/in/rstein66">Rachel Stein</a>. The source is available on <a href="https://github.com/jacquelinekay/facelibs">Github</a>.

    In the summer of 2013, I worked at the <a href="http://www.ri.cmu.edu/">
    CMU Robotics Institute</a> in planetary robotics. I investigated planning paths
    for a lunar rover based on solar energy and temperature states. You can read
    about the technical details in my <a href="assets/kay-poster-riss13.pdf">poster</a>.

    In spring 2013, I participated in a semester-long seminar on humanoid robotics at Swarthmore College. Our assignments built up to a physically plausible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_moment_point">ZMP</a> walking simulator for a humanoid robot. My collaborator David Nahmias and I documented our work <a href="http://blogs.sccs.swarthmore.edu/jke91/">here</a> and <a href="http://djrobotic.blogspot.com/">here</a>.
